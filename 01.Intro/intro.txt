It is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted language that is designed to be lightweight and easily embedded into other applications. JavaScript is primarily used to add interactivity to web pages, such as form validation, interactive maps, and dynamic content. It is also widely used in server-side programming and desktop application development. JavaScript has a large and active developer community, and is constantly evolving with new frameworks and libraries being developed to make web development more efficient and effective.
